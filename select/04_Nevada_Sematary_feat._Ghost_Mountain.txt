I keep a cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada
Cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada
Cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada
Cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada

Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada
Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada
Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada
Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada

Bury me, out in the back
Desert scape, left rotting in a broken shack
Nothing left but the hum crawling out the hills
Take me south, red house with the open fields

See them in the headlights, on the empty road
Death Valley, man eating like Tsavo
Skin dashboard, bones on the console
Catch you with my cutter, bury you behind the school

Haunted mound
Candles lifted when we come around
Scarecrows at the impound
4AM when we take the town

Sematary and Ghost Mound
Sunset across the fairground
Night cry out, no time now
This is Grave House, boy, it's what we about

I keep a cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada
Cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada
Cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada
Cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada

Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada
Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada
Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada
Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada

I been rocking back and fucking forth in the corner
I been getting super fucking gone till the morning
You believe in life, you're a dumb motherfucker
If you really wanna try we will run you over
I been coughing up blood, dying at McDonald's
I been mixing Benadryl and Tussin in my Monster
I'm glad the world's burning, I believe in monsters
I been in my Grave House, posted with my cutter

I need some brass knuckles and I need a shotgun
I'm a Skellington, riding out in a black truck
I been drinking Jaguar, and Red Bull, and Vodka
Hundred million dead cops, motherfuck everyone
I'm in Trevor mode, I will always say "Fuck the world"
We don't give a fuck, you can die, you can rot alone
3AM gang, you know why you're running
Bury you behind the church, down in Nevada

I keep a cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada
Cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada
Cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada
Cutter like Nevada, cutter like Nevada

Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada
Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada
Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada
Leave you in Nevada, leave you in Nevada
